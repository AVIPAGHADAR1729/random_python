# Replacing special characters in text

Replace alternative spellings of special characters in a given text.

Usage help (invoke from one directory up):

```bash
python -m special_character_replacer -h
```

Better yet (also important for tests to run reliably) is to install this package on
your system, in *editable* mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
